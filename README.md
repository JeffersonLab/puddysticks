# puddysticks
Control panels made easy

A pure web control system display manager with a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) display builder.
Create displays and export them as simple JSON files.  Wire up displays to datasources using a pluggable interface.  
Built-in datasources include a random number generator and epics2web.  This project is the sequel to
